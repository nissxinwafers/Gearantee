# Project Milestones

## Campus Equipment Borrowing & Reservation System

This plan covers the complete first version of the system using ASP.NET Core MVC with Razor Views, Microsoft SQL Server, Entity Framework Core's SQL Server provider, ASP.NET Core Identity, Tailwind CSS, and Brevo transactional email for password-reset OTP delivery.

**Tracking:** change `[ ]` to `[x]` as each task is completed.

## How to update this file

Update this file **in the same PR** that finishes or starts a feature.

1. Find the feature's row in the WBS Feature Tracker (match the WBS number).
2. Set **Status** to one of: `Not Started` · `In Progress` · `In Review` · `Done` · `Blocked`.
   - `In Progress` → fill **Actual Start**.
   - `In Review` → add the PR link (for example, `#12`).
   - `Done` → fill **Actual End** with the owner-confirmed completion date (use the merge date when no earlier completion date is confirmed) and keep the PR link.
3. Tick the related `[ ]` → `[x]` item(s) in the matching Milestone section only when *all* WBS rows for that item are `Done`.
4. Recalculate the Progress summary counts.
5. Add one line to the Change log.
6. Mirror Actual Start / Actual End in the WBS Google Sheet.

Dates use `M/D/YYYY` (the same format as the WBS sheet). Never change Baseline dates here — change them in the WBS sheet first, then copy them here.

## Milestone 1 — Project Foundation

**WBS:** 1.00

**Goal:** Create the application structure and database connection.

### Tasks

- [x] Confirm the ASP.NET Core MVC project structure with controllers and Razor Views.
- [x] Create/configure the Microsoft SQL Server development database with a non-secret LocalDB connection that can be overridden through user secrets or environment variables.
- [ ] Optionally use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to administer and inspect SQL Server; SSMS is not the database engine.
- [x] Use Entity Framework Core with `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`.
- [x] Add the initial entities and create/apply migrations based on the canonical ERD.
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS, its Razor content scanning, development watch command, and minified production build.
- [x] Establish the shared layout, navigation, Tailwind styling, error pages, and basic logging.
- [ ] Create development/production configuration separation.
- [x] Add GitHub Actions CI (build, EF migration check, vulnerable-package check, and CodeQL) and protect `main` (PR #6).

### Completion criteria

- The application runs locally.
- Entity Framework Core can create/update the SQL Server schema through migrations.
- The compiled Tailwind stylesheet is generated under `wwwroot` and loaded by the shared layout.
- The database contains the initial tables required by the ERD.
- No credentials are stored in source control.

---

## Milestone 2 — Authentication and Access Control

**WBS:** 3.00, 5.00–7.00, 9.00–12.00

**Goal:** Allow secure access and ensure each person sees only their authorized functions.

### Tasks

- [x] Configure ASP.NET Core Identity with SQL Server.
- [x] Seed the three roles and documented role-permission assignments.
- [x] Build Identity-backed registration, login, and logout pages.
- [x] Build role-based dashboards and navigation.
- [ ] Add account activation/deactivation behavior.
- [ ] Implement Forgot Password using Identity reset tokens, Brevo OTP delivery, and verified sender secrets.
- [x] Apply password policy, sign-in lockout, HTTPS redirect, and global authorization rules; apply per-page permission rules as each feature lands (PR #6).

### Completion criteria

- Users can log in and log out securely.
- Borrowers, custodians, and administrators land on the correct dashboard.
- Unauthorized pages/actions are blocked.
- An active user can reset their password through an expiring six-digit email OTP and a protected reset form.

## Milestone 4 — Equipment Discovery and Reservations

**WBS:** 34.00–37.00

**Goal:** Let borrowers find equipment and submit valid reservation requests.

### Tasks

- [x] Build the borrower equipment catalog with search and category/status filters.
- [x] Show equipment details and current availability.
- [x] Build the reservation form: item, requested release date/time, requested return date/time, and purpose.
- [x] Validate date/time ranges and borrower eligibility.
- [x] Implement reservation status: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Cancelled, and Expired.
- [x] Implement overlap detection for approved reservations and active loans of the same item.
- [ ] Build the borrower’s My Reservations and Active Loans pages.
- [x] Allow borrowers to cancel eligible pending reservations.

### Completion criteria

- Borrowers can submit and review their own reservation requests.
- The system prevents conflicting reservations for the same equipment item.
- Invalid dates, unavailable items, and ineligible borrowers are rejected with clear messages.
- New requests appear in the custodian approval queue.

---

## Milestone 5 — Approval, Release, and Return Workflow

**WBS:** 39.00–42.00, 44.00–47.00

**Goal:** Complete the controlled equipment handover and return lifecycle.

### Tasks

- Damaged items are not automatically made available.

---

## Milestone 6 — Availability Calendar and Reports

**WBS:** 49.00–50.00, 52.00–55.00

**Goal:** Give users visibility into schedules and give staff operational accountability.

### Tasks

## Open questions

- **OTP vs reset link (WBS 10.00–11.00).** Resolved for PR #19: the system uses a six-digit OTP delivered through Brevo, stores only its hash in `AspNetUserTokens`, and creates the protected Identity reset token only after successful OTP verification.
- **Milestone 8 (Deployment)** has no WBS rows. Decide whether it is in scope for this term.

## Suggested Implementation Order

```text
Foundation
    → Authentication and roles
        → Users, profiles, categories, equipment
            → Reservation and conflict validation
                → Approval, release, and return
                    → Calendar and reports
                        → Testing, deployment, and handover
```

## Definition of Done for Version 1

The first version is complete when borrowers can securely reserve one available equipment item per reservation; custodians can approve, release, and receive it; administrators can manage people and inventory; and authorized users can view availability and transaction history. All core actions must be protected by Identity roles/permissions, stored in Microsoft SQL Server, styled with the compiled Tailwind CSS output, and usable through the deployed ASP.NET Core MVC application.
